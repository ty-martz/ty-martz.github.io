title: Pollution in India
---

For my Practicum course during my masters program at Georgia Tech, I took on a project with a sponsor company to look into pollution and economic growth in India. I spent the fall semester of 2022 conducting research, planning, gathering data, drafting, visualizing, re-working, and finalizing the final deliverables including a paper and a dashboard. I can't thank the sponsor company and Georgia Tech enough for giving me the opportunity to learn and be challenged with this project.

## Abstract

> Understanding and measuring pollution is a difficult yet import task to properly undertake since it expands our understanding of air quality. Levels of emissions and air quality often vary and it is vital to understand what effects this can have on individuals and economies. In this paper, I focus on India, as a fast-growing nation with a great deal of land and a large population. To evaluate and measure pollution levels I make use of a number of sources of data including emission measurements (CO, NO<sub>2</sub> , SO<sub>2</sub>, and PM<sub>2.5</sub>), weather, and more to develop machine learning models that fill in reporting gaps. With this data I am able to understand correlation and relationships between these 4 gasses and growth in India. In my results, I find that no gas in particular is a strong predictor across all cities, but one or two can be significant. In one city, a 1% month-over-month increase in SO<sub>2</sub> correlates with a -3% change in unemployment by month. My analysis also indicates that measuring stations provide the best results when more stations are capturing data. During the COVID-19 pandemic, all pollutants had a mainly inverse relationship with cases, except for SO<sub>2</sub> which remained mostly flat throughout.
