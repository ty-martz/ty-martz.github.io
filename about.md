I am a creative analyst with a passion for learning as I am working through my Master's degree in Analytics at Georgia Tech building exciting data models while working as a full-time Business Analyst. I have spent the last few years working with financial, research, product, and reporting data using tools like SQL, Python, and PowerBI to create meaningful dashboards, automate reporting, and improve processes. My more general interests fall under health/fitness, sustainability, energy, and food. Reach out to learn more about me and my passions

Stay tuned for some blogging and thoughts on topics I find interesting.
